1) Read the TASKS.md list, get any helpful context needed for the next few tasks on the list, think deeply about the best way to implement them.
2) Ask yourself if it would be helpful to bring yourself up to speed on any aspects of your plan where your documentation or understanding might be outdated from your training set.
3) Do internet research if requisite and use 2025 in your searches (NOT 2024) to get the most up to date results.
4) Craft a detailed expert plan for how to complete the next few tasks. If any of the next couple tasks include resolving errrors, make sure you include in your plan how you will fix those errors without causing errors somewhere else in the codebase.
6) Pass that plan to another version of yourself who has a SR Developer Persona. Have him critique and provide recommendations for the current plan.
7) Take the new plan with recommendations, and execute on it until it is complete.
