# OpenAI API Cost Analysis for Script Generation

## Overview
Analyzing the cost implications of different approaches for the script generation agent.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Token Usage Breakdown
- **Script Prompt**: ~280 tokens (the instructions you provided)
- **Actor Name Variable**: ~5-10 tokens
- **Expected Output**: ~800-850 words â‰ˆ 1,200-1,300 tokens
- **Total per request**: ~1,500-1,600 tokens

### 2. Cost Comparison

#### Option A: Full Prompt Every Time
- Input tokens per request: ~285 tokens
- No persistent state needed
- Simple implementation

#### Option B: Persistent Agent with Instructions
- Initial setup: Store base instructions in agent
- Per request: Only send actor name + minimal context
- Input tokens per request: ~50-100 tokens (significant reduction)

#### Option C: Fine-tuned Model
- Train a model specifically for biography scripts
- Minimal prompt needed per request
- Higher upfront cost but lowest per-request cost

### 3. OpenAI Agents SDK Specifics

The SDK doesn't inherently save tokens by storing instructions. Each API call still sends the full context. However, the SDK provides:

1. **Better Organization**: Clean separation of concerns
2. **Tracing & Debugging**: Built-in monitoring
3. **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic
4. **Future-proofing**: Easy to switch models or add tools

### 4. Recommendations

**For your use case, I recommend:**

1. **Short term (Development/Testing)**: Use the Agents SDK with the full prompt template. This gives you:
   - Flexibility to iterate on the prompt
   - Easy A/B testing of different instructions
   - Built-in tracing to debug issues

2. **Medium term (Production)**: Consider creating a custom GPT or Assistant via the Assistants API:
   - Store instructions persistently
   - Reduce per-request token usage by ~70%
   - Maintain conversation context if needed

3. **Long term (Scale)**: Fine-tune a model:
   - Lowest per-request cost
   - Fastest response times
   - Most consistent outputs

## Cost Calculations

Assuming o3-mini pricing (hypothetical, as actual pricing not yet announced):
- If similar to GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.15/1M input tokens, $0.60/1M output tokens

Per script:
- Full prompt: ~285 input + 1,250 output tokens
- Cost: ~$0.001 per script

At scale (1,000 scripts/month):
- Full prompt method: ~$1.00/month
- Optimized method: ~$0.30/month
- Savings: ~$0.70/month or 70%

## Next Steps

1. Start with the simple full-prompt approach
2. Monitor actual token usage with the SDK's tracing
3. Optimize once you have real usage data
4. Consider Assistants API when ready for production
